## ℹ️ Project Introduction  
Employee attrition means employees leave or resign from the company.

To every company, human is always the biggest asset. It is really important to understand whether employees will resign the company due to dissatisfying working environment, working culture, carear development, ect. When employees leave the company unexpectedly, companies need to spend big amount of time searching, hiring, and training new substitute employees. Furthermore, the substitute employees still need to take some time to bring the profit to the organization.

## 🎯 Mission & Goal
As a data scentist working in HR department, I am asked to build a model to predict possible resignation based on the given dataset.
The outcome of model should include the following:
  - Model is capable of forseeing the possible resignation with high accuracy.
  - Provide a valuable insight to organization which factors are the significant driving forces contributing employee attrition. This will be used to conduct the certain action within organization for improvement.
