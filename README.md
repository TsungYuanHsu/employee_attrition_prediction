# 📝 Employee Attrition Prediction

## ✍️ Author
I'm Tsung Yuan Hsu and I am a self taught data scientist.  
To demonstrate the value as a data scientist, I created this project to predict employee attrition with exploratory data analysis and machine learning technique.

## 🌟 Highlights
From this project "Employee Attrition Prediction", the highlights are addressed as:  
- Correlation summary to understand the feature relationship with attrition.
  - Top 5 Positive features: OverTime, Single status, Job roles, and Frequent business travel.
  - Top 5 Negative features: High monthly income, High years in current role, High job level, High total working years, and overtime condition.
- Build end-to-end ML pipeline including train test separation, preprocessing pipeline, hyperparameter tuning, cross validation, and evaluation.
- Performance comparison between random forest classification, logistic regressionm, and XGBoost.
- In line with the goal and mission, XGBoost will be the chosen prediction model as higher precision.
- Significant factors for employee attrition are stock option, total working years, business travel frequency, and overtime condition.

## ℹ️ Project Introduction  
**Employee attrition means employees leave or resign from the company**

To every company, human is always the biggest asset. It is really important to understand whether employees will resign the company due to dissatisfying working environment, working culture, carear development, ect. When employees leave the company unexpectedly, companies need to spend big amount of time searching, hiring, and training new substitute employees. Furthermore, the substitute employees still need to take some time to bring the profit to the organization.

## 🎯 Mission & Goal
As a data scentist working in HR department, I am asked to build a model to predict possible resignation based on the given dataset.
The outcome of model should include the following:  
- Model is capable of forseeing the possible resignation with high accuracy.
- Provide a valuable insight to organization which factors are the significant driving forces contributing employee attrition. This will be used to conduct the certain action within organization for improvement.
